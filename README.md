## Agile Planning and Development Process
The development of HW|Blog followed an Agile methodology, utilizing a Kanban board hosted on GitHub to manage tasks and workflows. This approach made it easier to focus on immediate tasks while also keeping an eye on the broader project goals and progress.

### Kanban Board

[Link to the board](https://github.com/users/GKopanidis/projects/5)

The board was divided into three primary columns:

- **Todo:** Tasks that are planned but not yet in progress.
- **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done:** Tasks that have been completed.

Each task was created as an issue and then categorized into Epics and User Stories for better organization and focus.

### Epics and User Stories

Prior to starting development, Epics and User Stories were created to define the scope and goals of the project. This made it easier to break down the project into smaller, manageable chunks and helped in tracking progress effectively.

- **Epics**: Large areas of work that contain multiple tasks.
- **User Stories**: Smaller tasks that contribute to the completion of an Epic.

This Agile planning setup contributed significantly to the efficient and focused development of Loop

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio Code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘ci-pp4-hwblog’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Navigate to heroku and create an account
- Click the new button in the top right corner
- Select create new app
- Enter app name
- Select region and click create app
- Click the resources tab and search for Heroku Postgres
- Select hobby dev and continue
- Go to the settings tab and then click reveal config vars
- Add the following config vars:
  - SECRET_KEY: (Your secret key)
  - DATABASE_URL: (This should already exist with add on of postgres)
  - CLOUNDINARY_URL: (cloudinary api url)
- Click the deploy tab
- Scroll down to Connect to GitHub and sign in / authorize when prompted
- In the search box, find the repository you want to deploy and click connect
- Scroll down to Manual deploy and choose the main branch
- Click deploy

The app should now be deployed.

### Creating a Database

- Log into ElephantSQL.com and access your dashboard.
- Click "Create New Instance".
- Set up a plan, name it, and select the closest data center.
- Click "Review" and "Create instance".
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and copy the database URL.

### The env.py File
- Create an env.py file and ensure it's in .gitignore.
- Add DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to env.py.
- If using Cloudinary, add CLOUDINARY_URL to env.py.

### Run Locally

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

- Click on the code drop down button
- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now have been cloned on your local machine for use.

### Fork Project

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.
